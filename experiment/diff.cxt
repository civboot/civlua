civboot will use two diff algorithms: [+
* patience diff for user-readable diffs, implemented in pure-lua
* (optional) bentley_mcilroy for both single-file and change-file compression,
  implemented in C
]

Based on what I've seen those are both easy to implement and very effective for
their intended purpose.
