[{h1}TODO list for CXT]

[{h2}Whitespace aware quote block]
I would like to allow the following to strip preceeding whitespace
and FAIL if anything exists in said whitespace

[###

[+
  * This is a normal list item
  * This is a list item with some code:
    [##
    This is a bit of code
    for the above
    ]##
  * Another normal list item
]
]###

The code block above should NOT have any preceeding whitespace.

This should be relatively easy, since we just have to detect leading
whitespace for [$raw] blocks and check+strip them.

[{h2}Html]
First of all I need to handle special characters:
[##
 &   &amp;
 <   &lt;
 >   &gt;
]##

Inline code for html is a bit more complicated. I should use 'samp' (sample)
instead of 'code' or 'pre', since 'samp' works for inline code and I already
handle adding [$<br>] to relevant points.

Also: all spaces should become '&nbsp;' and all newlines become '<br>'

So a before and after:

[###
CXT:
function foo()
  a   = "hi"
  abc = "hi there"
  return a .. abc
end

HTML:
<samp>
function <b>foo</b>()<br>
&nbsp; a &nbsp; = "hi"<br>
&nbsp; abc = "hi there"<br>
&nbsp; return a .. abc<br>
end<br>
</samp>
]###

It's not pretty... but it just goes to show how HTML is not pretty. Also, I
threw in the [$<b>foo</b>] to show that you can still add formatting in code
blocks. I will utilize this for syntax highlighting.
