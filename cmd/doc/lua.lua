--- for is a looping construct with two forms:
---
--- Numeric: [{## lang=lua}
---   for i=si,ei,period do -- period=1 by default
---     ... do something with i
---   end
---
---   -- is basically the same as
---   local i = si
---   while i <= ei do i = i + si
---     ... do something with i
---   end
--- ]##
---
--- Generic: [{## lang=lua}
---   for i, v, etc in (nextfn, state, _index) do
---     .. do something with i, v, ...
---   end
---
---   -- is almost the same as
---   while true do
---     local i, v, etc = nextfn(state, _index)
---     if i == nil then break end
---     _index = i -- note: C internal, _index from lua doesn't change
---     ... code using i, v, etc here
---   end
--- ]##
---
--- The goal in writing a stateless iterator function is to match this
--- loop's API as much as possible.
---
--- Example rewriting ipairs: [{## lang=lua}
---   local function rawipairs(t, i)

---     iterates through (1, 5) -> (2, 6) -> (3, 7)
