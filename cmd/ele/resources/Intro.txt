Welcome to Ele, the extendable lua editor for text and code.
Ele is a modal editor (similar to vim), which makes it both powerful and fun to
use.

HOW TO EXIT: press cntl+q twice.

* type "space ? ?" for the help introduction.
* type "space ? t" to navigate the tree of available options in your current mode.

This buffer will now be used as the command buffer. Basic operation:
* in insert mode write lua scripts and type "enter enter" to execute one stanza
  * a stanza is a set of non-empty lines.
  * Note: this will also add an empty line to the executed stanza.
* in command mode you may also type "enter" to execute the current stanza

list the current directory with:
    list''<enter><enter>
  alternatively in command mode:
    space f l  (aka find list)

  - use j/k or arrow keys to go up/down to select a file
  - in command mode, select a file to open by typing "g l" (goto line)

open a file by typing:           o'path/to/file.txt'<enter><enter>
