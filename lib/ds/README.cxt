[{h1}ds: lua data structures and algorithms]
[$ds] is a small-ish lua library which fills many of the data structure and
method gaps (needed "batteries") in Lua's standard library. It's only
dependency is [/lib/metaty] which it uses for defining it's records and
[/lib/fmt] which it uses to define the logging interface.
