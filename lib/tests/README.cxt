This contains tests of the bootstrapping libraries.

These cannot be inside the same directory as their library because all
non-bootstrapped targets must depend on [$civ:cmd/civ] to be buildable. Technically we
could have marked these as also bootstrapped, but then we wouldn't be
eating our own dogfood as much as we like.
