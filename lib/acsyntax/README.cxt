[{h1}asciicolor syntax highlighting.]

This module contains a standardized method to configure syntax
highlighting.

Syntax highlighting is typically configured in an editor which supports lua
(like ele). The editor can either use acsyntax functions directly, modify
acsyntax exported tables or allow users ot modify acsyntax tables. Ele does the
latter.
