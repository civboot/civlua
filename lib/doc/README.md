# doc: documentation of lua's core types

Get documentation on any Lua object in a `mod` (see
[PKG.mod](../pkg/README.md)).

Also documents lua syntax and standard types. These docs are intentionally brief
and minimal.

* Tutorial style documentation: https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html

Contributions welcome. All contributions must be in the public domain (like this
library is).
