Civtest: absurdly simple test library

This is a no-frills test library. It simply builds on [/lib/metaty] and
[/lib/ds] to provide the simplest possible needs for testing. Your tests
are just a lua file which something (i.e. [<civ.html>]) executes. This library
provides helpers to print helpful headers for each test and provide
superior assertions.

  T.eq('some expected\ntext', 'some actual\ntext')
