General
* I need io.open/etc to respect G.PWD
* Have good way to check if sh command exists.
  Check for stuff in pvc, especially merge (install rcs).
* The cxt info boxes are rendering very far away from the next
  element, i.e. in pvc.at
* civtest shows two "pathEq" because two variables are assigned it. Fix that behavior.

Need a mty.recordmod. Use for
* ds.Grid
* ds.IFile
