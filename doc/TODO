* I don't think civix.sh is passing stdout through. That should happen by
  default.
* I need io.open/etc to respect G.PWD
* Have good way to check if sh command exists.
  Check for stuff in pvc, especially merge (install rcs).
* The cxt info boxes are rendering very far away from the next
  element, i.e. in pvc.at
