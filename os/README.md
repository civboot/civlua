This directory is WIP and is for holding code and notes
relevant for creating a "Civboot operating system".

It is planned to include the following directories:
* iA/ intermediate assembly, a programming language
   for writing straightforward cross-platform assembly.
* lua/ a lua interpreter written in iA.
* boot/ a bootloader.
* driver/ drivers for various hardware and for running
  civos in "user mode" on other operating systems.
* fs/ a filesystem built on top of various drivers.

And other libraries that CivOS requires.
